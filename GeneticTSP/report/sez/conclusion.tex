\section{Conclusion}
The project gave me the opportunity to apply the theory seen during the course to a real world problem. The initial design of the parallel architecture was strictly correlated to the results obtained from the analysis of the sequential program to find the application bottleneck. Also at the beginning it was challenging to deal with the parallel implementation of the algorithm with the standard C++ threads, the error generated by the parallel program were hard to find (and debugging) manually, but thanks to tools like Valgrind or ThreadSanitizer they were quite easy to found and fix. However, these errors made me understand the purpose of parallel skeleton framework like Fastflow that hide all the parallelism complexity to the programmer.
